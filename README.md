# Example_08 From "Getting Started with Arduino, Second Edition"

Updated and fixed ***Example 08A*** processing sketch from this book. 
I did ***NOT*** touch the arduino code as of yet. I may eventually fully 
test both pieces to ensure they work together, or update them otherwise.

I hope this helps others out there who wanted to fully complete this project like I did.
